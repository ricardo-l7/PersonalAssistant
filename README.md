# PersonalAssistant
This simple "Personal Assistant" website was the first website I made using JavaScript and React. Specifically, I made it during my winter break web development bootcamp run by Harvard Student Agencies: Development. 

It is a simple website that consists of three pages: a homescreen, a page that helps manage the user's  todos for the day, and page that tells the user the weather in their area.

To run the App, clone the repository into VSCode, install the required dependencies by typing "npm i" in the terminal, type "npm run dev" in the terminal, and then go to http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. 

Enjoy!
